# Curing ðŸ’Š
Curing is a POC of a malware that uses `io_uring` to perform different tasks without using any syscalls, making it invisible to security tools like Falco and Tetragon which are monitoring syscalls.
The idea was born at the latest CCC conference #38c3, therefor the name `Curing` which is a mix of `C` and `io_uring`.

## POC
You can find a full demo of bypassing Falco with `curing` [here](poc/POC.md).
In the POC, you will also find the commands to build and run the `curing` client and server.

## Proving 0 syscalls
To prove that the malware is not using any syscalls, you can use the following command:
```bash
strace -f -o /tmp/strace.log ./build/client
```
0 syscalls is of course not possible, but the idea is to prove that the malware is not using any syscalls that are related to the attack, only the `io_uring` syscalls are used.

## How it works
The `curing` client is connecting to the `curing` server and is pulling commands from the server to execute. The server is sending commands to the client to read files, write files, create symbolic links, etc. The client is using `io_uring` to execute the commands and send the results back to the server.
Because the client is using `io_uring`, it is not using any syscalls that are related to the attack, making it invisible to security tools that are monitoring syscalls.
To know more about `io_uring`, you can check the [official documentation](https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf).
